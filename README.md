The Project focuses on creating an easy, effective and user-friendly experience for users who require assistance in their hotel selection. This ensures that users could get the appropriate hotel of their interest while removing the time-consuming selection by recommending them hotels according to their capacity and filtering criteria. Creating a good information and status flow between users and hotels will create an environment that benefits both parties in terms of time, money and different criteria that follow. This service solves problems in different areas for both hotels and users in creating an effective and efficient information flow. The problems fixed through the process mainly focus on areas such as Ineffective and time-consuming research done by users to find a hotel that suits them, no or less databases on rooms booked by hotels and hotels not knowing about the competition and user’s requirements to upgrade their standards. The website implements a platform where websites can attract users and provide information while the users use the information provided to select their hotel of interest. It creates a link of contact between users and hotels to inquire and share information with each other.

1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Background Our project Hotel reservation platform is a website that allows customers that are looking to book a hotel room in different sizes and number of beds to get the best desired fit. We are motivated to do this project to build a platform that satisfies customer’s needs. Customers of this website can be Ethiopian citizens or any citizen of the world who are visiting or living in Ethiopia. This website will allow for more than one hotel to be on it, and customers can filter hotels by location, budget, and users rating. It truly is a centralized platform for hotels. The project will take the time from Nov 10, 2021 up-to the end of this semester (Which is Feb 10, 2021).

But the problem is that only famous or elegant hotels have their own website. Due to this, customers who are looking to book hotel rooms aren’t having the chance to get the most affordable and desired hotel room out there. If we look at it from the hotels perspective, not all hotels have their own website that let’s their customers do their transaction online, through this platform hotels can offer their services and price information so their usual and new customers can see and decide. Even hotels having their own website can sign-up and provide their own services, but booking will be made on their own site. 1.3. Statement of the Problem We believe that this problem have existed, as long as we know it. We have seen solutions for this problems in other countries such as Booking.com, Trivago and maybe more. Furthermore, this websites are famous and successful on providing what their customers wants by giving them choices based on the customers price range, location, type of services wanted. But the problem is this websites don’t provide any services in
